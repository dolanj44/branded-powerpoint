# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal project containing only an empty HTML file (`test.html`). The repository currently has no build system, dependencies, or development configuration.

## Current Structure

- `test.html` - Empty HTML file (likely for testing/placeholder purposes)

## Development Commands

No build system or package manager is currently configured. Future development may require:

- Setting up a package manager (npm, yarn, etc.) if JavaScript development is needed
- Configuring build tools if this becomes a web application
- Adding linting and testing frameworks as development progresses

## Notes for Future Development

Since this is currently an empty project, any significant development work will likely require:

1. Determining the intended project type (static HTML, web application, etc.)
2. Setting up appropriate tooling and dependencies
3. Establishing project structure and conventions
4. Adding this information back to CLAUDE.md once established
